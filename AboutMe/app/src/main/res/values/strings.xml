    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is SaeeAM.
\n\nI love My Ibm Frends.
\n\nMy Ibm Frends Are All Student Who Study in ibm Batch 2022-2024 and all other students.
\nFew Frends are close me like me name is Bunny, subham, ajay, madan, vishmita, and others.
\n\nI like eating vagetrian, too. Raw Fruits. Coconut Oil. Not oil. Not to much mirch-machala - not so much.
\nAnd sometimes I even go dancing.
\nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
\n\nOnce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
\n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
\nYou should ask someone else about fishing, though.\n\n</string>
